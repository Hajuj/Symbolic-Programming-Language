# Abstract
This course will use the Python programming language as the basis for various computational linguistic implementations. It covers a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as tokenization, keyword extraction, normalization and stemming, categorization and tagging, as well as classification, chunking and language identification. All the latter are basic NLP tasks that will be discussed and their implementation in Python will be realized during the practical exercise in connection to the course. With respect to each task, we will concentrate on the problems that this task faces and the possible solutions to them within the Python framework.
